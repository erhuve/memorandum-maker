#NYU COVID-19 Summary Update Generator

This web app uses a RNN in TensorFlow trained on "COVID-19 Summary Update" emails from the NYU provost to generate a never-before seen, fake COVID-19 Summary Update email. The app is deployed using Flask on Heroku, and you can find that [here](http://memorandum-maker.herokuapp.com/)

It of course doesn't work perfectly, and some words are improperly formed, but for the most part it looks at least a little real... maybe.

This project was purely for fun and to learn/practice some skills. Enjoy!
