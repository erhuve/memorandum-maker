# NYU COVID-19 Summary Update Generator

![Screenshot of app](image.png?raw=true "Title")

This web app made in Flask uses a RNN in TensorFlow trained on "COVID-19 Summary Update" emails from the NYU provost to generate a never-before seen, fake COVID-19 Summary Update email. 

It of course doesn't work perfectly, and some words are improperly formed, but for the most part it looks at least a little real... maybe.

This project was purely for fun and to learn/practice some skills. Enjoy!
